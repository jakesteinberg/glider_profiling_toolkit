# glider_profiling_toolkit
This project is a package designed to take netcdf files of Seaglider dives and use them to pre-process data outputting temperature, salinity, and density profiles. These are used to estimate cross-track geostrophic velocity using what we term the M/W method. Along-track density gradients are estimated and the thermal wind balance is employed to estimate vertical shear. Relative velocity profiles are then referenced to a glider inferred depth average current (DAC). dive_processing_and_velocity_estimation.py is the main script containing the Glider object and all functions needed. use_glider_object.py is meant to serve as the user interface. Glider dive directories are specified and plotting/processing choices are made. tools.py is a side file needed to run other files with general functions.
